# Welcome to Alpha 1.0.1!

In this release I edited many configs so that the modpack will function more like how I imagined it for the release!
There are still things to be worked on, some menu's need to get a **BIG** revamp, quests are worked on etc.


# What has changed?

 - Surviving the first couple of nights won't be as difficult as compared to A 1.0.0!
 - Changed out **Spice of life: Carrot Edition** for **Spice of life: Onion Edition**. This means that you need to keep eating more balanced instead of trying out different food. You'll need to get cooking different meals now!
 - Added the magic mod **Mahou Tsukai**!
 - Changed the recipes for **Sophisticated Backpacks**! They won't be as easy too make now!
 - Added a recipe to get **Rose Quartz** coming from the **Rose Quartz Chunks** that you can find generating naturally in the nether. They finally have a use!
