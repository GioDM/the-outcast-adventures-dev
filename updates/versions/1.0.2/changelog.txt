# Welcome to Alpha 1.0.2!

In the last release I saw that structures didn't spawn as often as I hoped for.
I added a structure mod and changed some configs in order to up the frequency of structures spawning.
There are still things to be worked on: quests, balancing mods, making custom datapacks, etc.


# What has changed?

 - Updated most mods to latest version.
 - Added a custom datapack for getting more **curious** slots.
 - Added **Chipped** so you can express your build with more personality.
 - **Resource packs** will be automatically applied when joining.
 - Added **Villager Guards** so your villagers can rest at night knowing that they are protected.
 - Fixed some bugs with the custom menu's.
