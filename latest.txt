&lWelcome to Alpha 1.0.2!&r

In the last release I saw that
structures didn't spawn as
often as I hoped for.
I added a structure mod and changed
some configs in order to up the
frequency of structures spawning.
There are still things to be worked on:
quests are worked on, balancing mods,
making custom datapacks, ...

&lWhat has changed?&r

 - Updated most mods to latest version.
 - Added a custom datapack for getting
 more &b&lcurious&r slots.
 - Added &b&lChipped&r so you can express
 your build with more personality.
 - &b&lResource packs&r will be automatically
 applied when joining minecraft.
 - Added &b&lVillager Guards&r so your
 villagers can rest at night knowing that
 they are protected.
 - Fixed some bugs with the custom menu's.
